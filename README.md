This is a simple facebook like development.
You have to log in through facebook, else you can't post anything.
Once logged in, you can view all your posts in the last division.
When you post something, it immediately gets updated below. This will never post to your actual facebook wall.

For logout just logout from your facebook account.
In the insertintotable.php and loadrecords.php files, you have to put your database credentials.
